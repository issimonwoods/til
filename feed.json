Related updates have been made, alongside a number of additions throughout and outside of the site. You can check <a href=\"https://til.status.lol/655da600edc54\">the changelog</a> for a quick update.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://micro.blog/TIL/11424177\">the</a> <a href=\"http://til.micro.blog/2018/06/10/today-we-start.html\">first</a> <a href=\"https://swoods.net/2021/08/18/welcome-to-til.html\">time</a> in which I have introduced this site and the associated parts of the project. However, names are a funny thing; at once so very important and yet almost irrelevant. If it wasn&rsquo;t for signs and labels and other such markings I would easily forget a fair-sized list of names.</p>\n<p>Given that, I have had an increasing feeling of uncertainty when considering the name &ldquo;Today I Learned&rdquo;; specifically when said aloud it can be cumbersome and ill-fitting of my overall goal for the project. A resource for helping people use Micro.blog should not be difficult to even name.</p>\n<p>As such the site, and connected parts are now simply &ldquo;TIL&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s also a new domain: til.tips. A new banner is also in place, and relevant parts of the site have been edited to reflect this change, along with a further edit of the tag line:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The unofficial Micro.blog companion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(for context: &ldquo;and guide&rdquo; has been removed from the end)</p>\n<p>Brevity, as a quality, feels much more aligned to even the purpose of Micro.blog at the basic level; to be swift and effective. And so here we are. Lastly, I&rsquo;ve updated the off-site parts of TIL with the name, tag line, and links. There is also a redirect in place for the old name, just in case it&rsquo;s needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility-and-clarity\">Compatibility and clarity</h2>\n<p>I have a made a new, single-purpose page: <a href=\"https://til.tips/contact\">Contact</a>. It&rsquo;s just a simple contact form, an alternative way for folks to send me an email about anything to do with TIL at all.</p>\n<p>The contact page is hosted on <a href=\"https://letterbird.co\">Letterbird</a>, from the rather clever team at <a href=\"https://goodenough.us/\">Good Enough</a> and an addition I am very happy to have made; the easier it is for people to let provide feedback or ask questions, the better TIL can become.</p>\n<p>Over on the <a href=\"https://til.tips/about\">About page</a> I updated links for the aforementioned changes, and added two new sections; my philosophy and my sharing policy. I have thought about both of these sections on and off for quite a while. Whilst it is true that these are the first versions and improvements will be made over time, I did not want even the first version to be the result of a half-baked thought. As such I am so very happy to have finally found the right moment to publish these additions, to better represent the <em>exact</em> &ldquo;about&rdquo; of TIL.</p>\n<p>I have also made edits to the language on the page, further clarifying and maintaining relevant information.</p>\n<p>Next, for the <a href=\"https://til.tips/credits\">Credits page</a>; I have added a few entries in the form of plug-ins, CodePen, and the &ldquo;Software&rdquo; section. The library of Micro.blog plug-ins has grown considerably over the past couple of years and now offers a variety of options for enhancing your blog, alongside excellent support from plug-in authors across GitHub, the Help forums, and the timeline.</p>\n<p>CodePen, meanwhile, has been an invaluable resource for quickly testing changes to the site&rsquo;s theme. It is especially useful given my relative ignorance of software development regarding IDEs and the like. The &ldquo;Software&rdquo; section is now fully up to date and reflects my much more settled working environment with regard to tools; each item listed plays and increasingly important role in the work and represents the core of what I do here.</p>\n<p>The layout of the lower half of the page has also been improved, with clearer sections and relevant separation of different types of items. This has been further improved with the removal of outdated items.</p>\n<p>Lastly, for pages, is <a href=\"https://til.tips/funding\">Funding</a>. I gave this page something of a maintenance update; with improvements to language, and relevant links and information. The previous set of updates to TIL included much more of a focus for this page, specifically with regard to the Buy Me a Coffee page.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the <a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods\">Buy Me a Coffee page</a> now has a wishlist. When you visit the page you&rsquo;ll find it by one of two ways; either via the tab below the page description, or the new widget which shows the top two items and is a portal to the rest of the list. I believe this change makes it easier to see exactly how directly your donations can help my work across all of TIL.</p>\n<p>The rest of the page, including some posts, were given the relevant updates for the change in name and domain of TIL. There is also a new announcement covering these updates, specifically within the context of the donations page itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-past-and-the-future\">The past and the future</h2>\n<p>As I look to further improve the future of TIL, it became apparent that I still needed to consolidate the past. To begin with this has meant updating <a href=\"https://updates.micro.blog\">the old Updates site</a> by turning it into an archive; mostly this serves to point people in the right direction regarding news about Micro.blog, and I am glad to have settled the old site with an appropriate design.</p>\n<p>This feels like the right time to remind you of the primary sources for Micro.blog news:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.micro.blog\">Micro.blog News</a>; the official news blog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.blog/news\">@News</a>; the accompanying Micro.blog page for the blog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://manton.org\">Manton&rsquo;s blog</a>; more often than not Manton will at least announce the most substantial updates, and will often go into greater detail about them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see more official sources on the <a href=\"https://til.tips/links/core\">Core links page</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, for this initial set of updates I have create a new off-site branch of TIL; a new newsletter: <em>bts</em>.</p>\n<p>The aim of publishing this newsletter is as the name suggests; to provide a look behind-the-scenes of making TIL. That includes details about how I work, thoughts on Micro.blog, previews, and updates about what&rsquo;s happening and how to get involved.</p>\n<p>The welcome issue will be published tomorrow, Thursday the 23rd of November. You can follow along by signing up on <a href=\"https://til.tips/bts\">the Buttondown page</a>, on which I say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no release schedule, no spam, and no other way to get these posts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a look behind the scenes very much at my own pace, with no plans at all to add any sort of schedule or strict planning. The only exception to this will be during times in which people are generous enough to help me with feedback for previews and the like, and even then the conversations will likely continue in an organic manner, rather than by following a schedule.</p>\n<p>The reason I am not actively making the issues available as a blog is because I do not want to make another blog; my exact aim for everything I publish in this newsletter is for it all to fit <em>as a newsletter</em>. As with the nature of this new aspect of TIL, even this condition is subject to change; I have no complicated plan, only what you can already see and so we will see what happens!</p>\n<h3 id=\"orchid\">Orchid?</h3>\n<p>This is the first set of updates as part of an upgrade programme for TIL, which I have named <em>Orchid</em>. Over the next few months there will be more updates released in the same way, with the overall aim to provide substantial improvements to TIL in a number of ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next</h2>\n<p>The work for these changes truly progressed over the past few months, in the midst of the most important <a href=\"https://swoods.net/2023/09/04/absence-and-changelog.html\">move</a> our family has ever made. It seemed odd to me that I would spend any time working on anything other than move during this time, however, the way in which we planned the whole process meant that we were able to quickly take advantage of our new locale; specifically, the capacity this place holds for people like us to&hellip; take <em>a breath</em>. You know?</p>\n<p>Already Cornwall has given us, in no small measure, the opportunities needed not only to find a new home but begin living in what we have quickly come to feel; our place. It has been freeing beyond measure for me, and the work reflects that fact. These updates may have been planned and begun elsewhere, however it is here that I have actually shaped them to fit exactly what it is that TIL ought to be. Especially right now.</p>\n<p>Between my continuing satisfaction with <a href=\"https://til.status.lol\">omg.lol as host of the changelog</a> and the associated <a href=\"https://til.tips/2023/07/03/return-to-buy.html\">consolidation of meta updates on this site</a>, and now the launch of the <em>bts</em> newsletter it&rsquo;s fair to say that I&rsquo;ve finally found a balance for publishing meta updates. That resolution feels particularly good, in that I already feel calm relief for what had become a source of undue stress.</p>\n<p>The next step for Orchid will be released soon. This means the return of two important parts of TIL: Guides and regular posting. Finally, having spent an inordinate amount of time wrangling with Guides I have been able to settle on how they should work, both in the context of the whole site and as a singular resource. The regular set of posts, as can be seen on the About page, will return gradually over the course of Orchid; this decision came as a result of the time I spent to reconsider these updates and improve the overall plan, and I am glad to say that those decisions have borne their fruit.</p>\n<p>Whilst I do not currently have a publishing date for this next step, there is a chance I will share such a thing in the bts newsletter. In the meantime, I hope this set of updates helps only to further improve the quality of the existing resources here, and I can say with confidence that they have made it much easier for me to now progress into full and proper publishing activity.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the next part. And I am so very happy to finally be back.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>– Simon</p>\n",

The feeling I get from connecting to more of the open web, at the cost of the closed web, is... comfort, I think?\n\nMy previous plans for 2.0 have not worked as I originally had intended, and so my approach has now changed. I have already started writing the next update, covering this exact topic, and so I imagine that will be along much sooner than this post was from the last update. Certainly my path forward is much clearer and it is safe to say that I have found the renewed energy to finally get TIL back on track.\n\nUntil the next announcement, I'll see you all on the timeline.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n— Simon\n",

Also, in an addition inspired by Smokey Ardisson's _This Week on Micro.blog_ the Micro Monday newsletter now includes thumbnails of recent photos from across the community.\n\nOn the technical side of things, performance and stability improvements have been made to; Micro.blog in general; Sunlit; and LinkedIn cross-posting.\n\n- [Copy HTML](https://www.manton.org/2019/07/21/copy-html-for.html) • [How to: Copy HTML](https://til.micro.blog/2019/09/04/tip-you-can.html) • [Podcast categories updated](https://www.manton.org/2019/07/25/podcast-categories-updated.html) • [Newsletter thumnails](https://www.manton.org/2019/07/15/inspired-by-many.html) • [This Week on Micro.blog](https://www.ardisson.org/afkar/tag/thisweekonmicroblog/) • [Performance tweaks](https://news.micro.blog/2019/07/14/the-series-of.html) • [Sunlit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunlit/id1334727769?ls=1) • [LinkedIn fix](https://news.micro.blog/2019/07/21/fixed-our-linkedin.html)\n\n## Elsewhere\n\n- __Icro__ did not receive an update in the public release of the app but did get an improvement on the technical side of things, with Martin being able to remove CocoaPods from the app. This ought to make it easier for Martin to maintain the app.\n  - [Icro, by Martin Hartl](https://hartl.co/apps/icro/index.html) • [Martin's blog](https://hartl.co/)\n- __Gluon__ had a relatively quiet month with a single update. However, this included a few changes with some minor tweaks, the addition of the new Micro.blog tagmoji, and the removal of push notifications. Vincent explained that notifications would soon return, better than before.\n  - [Gluon, by Vincent Ritter](https://vincentritter.com/projects/gluon-for-micro-blog) • [Vincent's blog](https://vincentritter.com/)\n- __The Wiki__ received a few markdown-based additions on the main page and a minor edit to an existing category, as Smokey and Eli continued the steady progress of the new version.\n  - [Micro.wiki](https://m.b.wiki.eli.li)\n- A __Drafts Action__ for posting to Micro.blog with categories was updated by Craig McClellan, fixing a token-based issue that would cause the Action to break.\n  - [Craig's blog](https://craigmcclellan.com/) • [Fixing Post With Categories](https://craigmcclellan.com/2019/07/01/updates-to-post.html)\n\n__• • •__\n\nIt was great to see the team push on and fully embrace an active summer of updates. Hosted blogs are getting a lot of good new features whilst the platform as a whole continues to be improved on a regular basis, including an eye for stability and performance upgrades. Micro.blog continues to be supported with a thorough and carefully considered philosophy, whilst also embracing new ideas and feedback on a regular basis.\n\nWhilst summer can be altogether quiet for many people in the world of consumer software, web-based platforms have the opportunity to make substantial improvements before the rush of large updates in the latter part of the year and the team is doing just that.\n\nOn top of that there was some sad news regarding our community manager, Jean. Whilst visiting Slovenia she [became injured and had to return home early](https://micro.welltempered.net/2019/07/13/i-had-a.html). Fortunately the community rallied and offered support as they could, showing yet again that this platform, this entire project is _not_ just about technologies and the like but rather __the people are what matter__. Thankfully the team is made up of wonderful people and Jean is a fantastic representative for the community as a whole.\n\nEnjoy your weekend!\n\n-- Simon\n",

Other than that he has been asking for feedback on a couple of ideas as development continues at a steady pace.\n- [Indigenous, by Kristof De Jaeger](https://indigenous.abode.pub/android/)\n  - You can now share posts along with quoted text, whilst Upload is also available via the `Write` menu, and additions were made to the info section (README) on GitHub.\n- [MarsEdit, by Daniel Jalkut](https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/)\n  - Support for Hosted sites now includes showing post-modified dates, whilst a number of other fixes and interface improvements have been made. It is also now possible to resize animated GIFs while preserving animation.\n\nYou can see more about third-party updates on [the Elsewhere page](https://til.micro.blog/elsewhere/) and every month in [The Macro Report](https://til.micro.blog/categories/the-macro-report), as well as more about third-party development in general on [the Links page](https://til.micro.blog/links/).\n\nEnjoy the rest of your week!\n",

				"content_text": "There have recently been a few updates made across Today I Learned. Let's go over them, starting with the log:\n\nThere is a __new post type__:\n\n- _Guides_, the first of which [covers Pins](https://til.micro.blog/2018/11/20/guide-pins.html).\n\nThe following changes have been made to __pages__:\n\n- [Elsewhere](https://til.micro.blog/elsewhere) is a new page featuring the latest news about third-party development efforts.\n- [Links](http://til.micro.blog/links/) additions; three new sections covering a host of development efforts from outside of the Micro.blog team.\n- [About](http://til.micro.blog/about/)\n  - Simplified introduction.\n  - Added list of post types.\n  - New Links section.\n  - Merged Contact page.\n- For navigation:\n  - Contact link removed.\n  - Updates link removed.\n\nAltered the __theme__ to;\n\n- better display images;\n  - (h/t [@Miraz](https://micro.blog/Miraz) [1](http://miraz.me/2018/11/03/on-my-microblog.html) [2](http://miraz.me/2018/11/03/223214.html))\n- show paragraph headers more clearly.\n\nFor the __Updates blog__:\n\n- [History](https://updates.micro.blog/history/) is a new page; a timeline of updates made to Micro.blog.\n- The Macro Report is a new post type, a series covering the most recent period of activity.\n  - The first issue covered [October, 2018](https://updates.micro.blog/2018/11/09/the-macro-report.html).\n- Follow Up is a new post type, providing timely asides for updates.\n  - The first covered [the recent updates involving Mastodon](https://updates.micro.blog/2018/11/15/follow-up-the.html).\n- The site now displays bolded text properly.\n\n---\n\nIt's still early days yet but I'm happy with the progress made so far. The Micro.blog team have been hard at work improving the platform and providing support to the ever-growing community, which is a motivating factor to make TIL as good as it can be.\n\nThere is more yet to come, as well as continuing existing efforts at a steady pace. There is no doubt that the community itself is also a source of energy and inspiration, with a growing number of contributions made across a variety of skillsets and interests. Basically: you're all awesome. Thank you.\n\nIf there is anything you want to correct or generally comment on you can use the new contact section of the _About_ page to do so. In the meantime, that's all for now. Bye!\n\n-- Simon\n",
