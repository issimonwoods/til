<h2 id="welcome-to-til">Welcome to TIL!</h2>
<p>Today, Today I Learned becomes <strong>TIL: The unofficial Micro.blog companion</strong>. Related updates have been made, alongside a number of additions throughout and outside of the site. You can check <a href="https://til.status.lol/655da600edc54">the changelog</a> for a quick update.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL/11424177">the</a> <a href="http://til.micro.blog/2018/06/10/today-we-start.html">first</a> <a href="https://swoods.net/2021/08/18/welcome-to-til.html">time</a> in which I have introduced this site and the associated parts of the project. However, names are a funny thing; at once so very important and yet almost irrelevant. If it wasn&rsquo;t for signs and labels and other such markings I would easily forget a fair-sized list of names.</p>
<p>Given that, I have had an increasing feeling of uncertainty when considering the name &ldquo;Today I Learned&rdquo;; specifically when said aloud it can be cumbersome and ill-fitting of my overall goal for the project. A resource for helping people use Micro.blog should not be difficult to even name.</p>
<p>As such the site, and connected parts are now simply &ldquo;TIL&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s also a new domain: til.tips. A new banner is also in place, and relevant parts of the site have been edited to reflect this change, along with a further edit of the tag line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unofficial Micro.blog companion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(for context: &ldquo;and guide&rdquo; has been removed from the end)</p>
<p>Brevity, as a quality, feels much more aligned to even the purpose of Micro.blog at the basic level; to be swift and effective. And so here we are. Lastly, I&rsquo;ve updated the off-site parts of TIL with the name, tag line, and links. There is also a redirect in place for the old name, just in case it&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-and-clarity">Compatibility and clarity</h2>
<p>I have a made a new, single-purpose page: <a href="https://til.tips/contact">Contact</a>. It&rsquo;s just a simple contact form, an alternative way for folks to send me an email about anything to do with TIL at all.</p>
<p>The contact page is hosted on <a href="https://letterbird.co">Letterbird</a>, from the rather clever team at <a href="https://goodenough.us/">Good Enough</a> and an addition I am very happy to have made; the easier it is for people to let provide feedback or ask questions, the better TIL can become.</p>
<p>Over on the <a href="https://til.tips/about">About page</a> I updated links for the aforementioned changes, and added two new sections; my philosophy and my sharing policy. I have thought about both of these sections on and off for quite a while. Whilst it is true that these are the first versions and improvements will be made over time, I did not want even the first version to be the result of a half-baked thought. As such I am so very happy to have finally found the right moment to publish these additions, to better represent the <em>exact</em> &ldquo;about&rdquo; of TIL.</p>
<p>I have also made edits to the language on the page, further clarifying and maintaining relevant information.</p>
<p>Next, for the <a href="https://til.tips/credits">Credits page</a>; I have added a few entries in the form of plug-ins, CodePen, and the &ldquo;Software&rdquo; section. The library of Micro.blog plug-ins has grown considerably over the past couple of years and now offers a variety of options for enhancing your blog, alongside excellent support from plug-in authors across GitHub, the Help forums, and the timeline.</p>
<p>CodePen, meanwhile, has been an invaluable resource for quickly testing changes to the site&rsquo;s theme. It is especially useful given my relative ignorance of software development regarding IDEs and the like. The &ldquo;Software&rdquo; section is now fully up to date and reflects my much more settled working environment with regard to tools; each item listed plays and increasingly important role in the work and represents the core of what I do here.</p>
<p>The layout of the lower half of the page has also been improved, with clearer sections and relevant separation of different types of items. This has been further improved with the removal of outdated items.</p>
<p>Lastly, for pages, is <a href="https://til.tips/funding">Funding</a>. I gave this page something of a maintenance update; with improvements to language, and relevant links and information. The previous set of updates to TIL included much more of a focus for this page, specifically with regard to the Buy Me a Coffee page.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods">Buy Me a Coffee page</a> now has a wishlist. When you visit the page you&rsquo;ll find it by one of two ways; either via the tab below the page description, or the new widget which shows the top two items and is a portal to the rest of the list. I believe this change makes it easier to see exactly how directly your donations can help my work across all of TIL.</p>
<p>The rest of the page, including some posts, were given the relevant updates for the change in name and domain of TIL. There is also a new announcement covering these updates, specifically within the context of the donations page itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-past-and-the-future">The past and the future</h2>
<p>As I look to further improve the future of TIL, it became apparent that I still needed to consolidate the past. To begin with this has meant updating <a href="https://updates.micro.blog">the old Updates site</a> by turning it into an archive; mostly this serves to point people in the right direction regarding news about Micro.blog, and I am glad to have settled the old site with an appropriate design.</p>
<p>This feels like the right time to remind you of the primary sources for Micro.blog news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.micro.blog">Micro.blog News</a>; the official news blog.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/news">@News</a>; the accompanying Micro.blog page for the blog.</li>
<li><a href="https://manton.org">Manton&rsquo;s blog</a>; more often than not Manton will at least announce the most substantial updates, and will often go into greater detail about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see more official sources on the <a href="https://til.tips/links/core">Core links page</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, for this initial set of updates I have create a new off-site branch of TIL; a new newsletter: <em>bts</em>.</p>
<p>The aim of publishing this newsletter is as the name suggests; to provide a look behind-the-scenes of making TIL. That includes details about how I work, thoughts on Micro.blog, previews, and updates about what&rsquo;s happening and how to get involved.</p>
<p>The welcome issue will be published tomorrow, Thursday the 23rd of November. You can follow along by signing up on <a href="https://til.tips/bts">the Buttondown page</a>, on which I say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no release schedule, no spam, and no other way to get these posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a look behind the scenes very much at my own pace, with no plans at all to add any sort of schedule or strict planning. The only exception to this will be during times in which people are generous enough to help me with feedback for previews and the like, and even then the conversations will likely continue in an organic manner, rather than by following a schedule.</p>
<p>The reason I am not actively making the issues available as a blog is because I do not want to make another blog; my exact aim for everything I publish in this newsletter is for it all to fit <em>as a newsletter</em>. As with the nature of this new aspect of TIL, even this condition is subject to change; I have no complicated plan, only what you can already see and so we will see what happens!</p>
<h3 id="orchid">Orchid?</h3>
<p>This is the first set of updates as part of an upgrade programme for TIL, which I have named <em>Orchid</em>. Over the next few months there will be more updates released in the same way, with the overall aim to provide substantial improvements to TIL in a number of ways.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next</h2>
<p>The work for these changes truly progressed over the past few months, in the midst of the most important <a href="https://swoods.net/2023/09/04/absence-and-changelog.html">move</a> our family has ever made. It seemed odd to me that I would spend any time working on anything other than move during this time, however, the way in which we planned the whole process meant that we were able to quickly take advantage of our new locale; specifically, the capacity this place holds for people like us to&hellip; take <em>a breath</em>. You know?</p>
<p>Already Cornwall has given us, in no small measure, the opportunities needed not only to find a new home but begin living in what we have quickly come to feel; our place. It has been freeing beyond measure for me, and the work reflects that fact. These updates may have been planned and begun elsewhere, however it is here that I have actually shaped them to fit exactly what it is that TIL ought to be. Especially right now.</p>
<p>Between my continuing satisfaction with <a href="https://til.status.lol">omg.lol as host of the changelog</a> and the associated <a href="https://til.tips/2023/07/03/return-to-buy.html">consolidation of meta updates on this site</a>, and now the launch of the <em>bts</em> newsletter it&rsquo;s fair to say that I&rsquo;ve finally found a balance for publishing meta updates. That resolution feels particularly good, in that I already feel calm relief for what had become a source of undue stress.</p>
<p>The next step for Orchid will be released soon. This means the return of two important parts of TIL: Guides and regular posting. Finally, having spent an inordinate amount of time wrangling with Guides I have been able to settle on how they should work, both in the context of the whole site and as a singular resource. The regular set of posts, as can be seen on the About page, will return gradually over the course of Orchid; this decision came as a result of the time I spent to reconsider these updates and improve the overall plan, and I am glad to say that those decisions have borne their fruit.</p>
<p>Whilst I do not currently have a publishing date for this next step, there is a chance I will share such a thing in the bts newsletter. In the meantime, I hope this set of updates helps only to further improve the quality of the existing resources here, and I can say with confidence that they have made it much easier for me to now progress into full and proper publishing activity.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the next part. And I am so very happy to finally be back.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>– Simon</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is the last minor update to TIL before major changes are made, and soon the return of regular publishing. I&rsquo;ll cover the changes for now and a little about the future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the changes&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="buy-me-a-coffee">Buy Me a Coffee</h2>
<p>The donations page is back. Having previously switched to Memberful, I have since realised that creating a membership program doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whilst BMC was in fact a good fit. It can be as simple as needed <em>and</em> has capacity to offer more options for supporting TIL should that ever be needed.</p>
<p>The bio is now clearer; much more relevant with cleaner language and relevant links. I&rsquo;ll likely update this again in the future but I think it does a good job of introducing TIL.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also published an announcement for the return of the page, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonwoods/open-1607775">&ldquo;Open again&rdquo;</a>, which goes into greater detail. Other posts have been made available only to supporters, since they are no longer relevant to the current progress of the project.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have added a goal to the page which can be seen underneath the &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; widget; the cost of an annual hosted Micro.blog subscription. This is the top-most priority of costs and is similarly first to be listed on the Funding page.</p>
<h2 id="omglol">omg.lol</h2>
<p>TIL is now on omg.lol! I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun <a href="https://omg.til.tips/">setting up the profile page</a>, which is in an early preview mode, and getting to grips with the platform and how it can work with and alongside Micro.blog. A number of folks on Micro.blog already know well the excellent work that has been done by <a href="https://home.omg.lol/staff">Adam Newbold and the staff</a> over there.</p>
<p>The other public use I have made of omg.lol is the &ldquo;Statuslog&rdquo; feature, with which I am now <a href="https://til.status.lol/">posting the TIL Status Updates</a>. It is here that I provide the small, continuous updates to TIL, many of which were previously included in the Release Notes category on the site. The feed of Status Updates is included in the TIL Micro.blog timeline as some of you might have already noticed, and is available for anybody to use via RSS.</p>
<p>As a result of the new Status Updates feed the news posts on this site will instead be more like this very post; longer posts for announcements and related ideas, with reduced focus on every little change. Since the focus of posts here are as resources for using Micro.blog, it feels good to minimise the amount of meta subject-centred writing whilst also keeping it public in a separate space for those who are interested. Finally, my personal blog will no longer be used as a source of news at all; although I may still link to the most significant updates.</p>
<p>I look forward to trying out more of the ways in which Micro.blog and omg.lol can either interoperate or at least work in a complimentary fashion.</p>
<h2 id="1910">1.9.10</h2>
<p>I have made several updates to the site itself; this includes and relates to external platforms.</p>
<p>The header and footer have both finally been improved with regard to the layout of the &ldquo;Following&rdquo; icons, the addition of a new separator for the end of posts and pages, and overall design when using smaller screens. The central &ldquo;Join&rdquo; column of the footer has also been replaced with a &ldquo;Support&rdquo; column, in the process of swapping the membership offering for the donations page.</p>
<p>Given the aforementioned change to how updates are published, the post category for announcements regarding changes has been changed from &ldquo;Release Notes&rdquo; to &ldquo;News&rdquo;. The ICYMI and About pages have been edited to reflect this switch, whilst the latter also now has an Elsewhere section that includes the newly launched omg.lol and Mastodon extensions of TIL. The support section of the About page has also been updated to switch the previous membership program for Buy Me a Coffee.</p>
<p>The final changes to pages have been for the Funding page, which now includes a much improved list of goals; there is greater detail and the information is up-to-date. I have also expanded the last section of the page, &ldquo;Making a donation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added a new page: <a href="https://til.tips/tweets/">Tweets</a>. This archive is the remaining copy of these posts, since I have deleted this account.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I have enabled ActivityPub integration so that it is now possible to get <a href="https://micro.blog/TIL?remote_follow=1">a feed of posts from the site</a> via Mastodon; this link has taken the place of the Twitter profile, where relevant, on the site.</p>
<hr>
<p>It has been both a lot of fun and a relief to work on TIL again. The feeling I get from connecting to more of the open web, at the cost of the closed web, is&hellip; comfort, I think?</p>
<p>My previous plans for 2.0 have not worked as I originally had intended, and so my approach has now changed. I have already started writing the next update, covering this exact topic, and so I imagine that will be along much sooner than this post was from the last update. Certainly my path forward is much clearer and it is safe to say that I have found the renewed energy to finally get TIL back on track.</p>
<p>Until the next announcement, I&rsquo;ll see you all on the timeline.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>— Simon</p>

			 <p>This is the last update for the current version of TIL, and includes a decision about the current publishing status of the project.</p>
<h2 id="the-changelog">The Changelog</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed the order of the &ldquo;Follow&rdquo; icons in the header and footer.</li>
<li>Fixed the link for ICYMI on the About page.</li>
<li>The site&rsquo;s software has been updated to the latest Hugo version possible (0.91).</li>
<li>Edited the Micro.blog and Twitter profiles to make the Contact and Support links clearer.</li>
<li>Halted all publishing activity until 2.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>
<p>Though minor, I&rsquo;m happy to have made these changes within version 1. I didn&rsquo;t get everything done but I&rsquo;m glad to have moved the site onto the latest possible version of the hosted software; Micro.blog has supported version 0.91 of Hugo for a while, and it is best for the site to be up-to-date.</p>
<p>Posting on the regular schedule has been difficult this summer, at least to a much larger degree than I had originally planned. As such I am now halting regular posting and will resume full publishing alongside the update to 2.0.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to returning with the update, and hope to even better help as many people as possible become as confident and comfortable as possible with Micro.blog</p>
<p>If you want to know about 2.0 when it is released, you can <a href="https://til.tips/icymi">subscribe to ICYMI</a>. More information can be found <a href="https://til.tips/about/">on the About page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and see you on the other side.</p>

<h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>
<p>The Introducing series of posts highlight different members of the community, including a screenshot of their site and relevant links. When creating and publishing these posts I have never once stopped to ask consent from the people featured therein.</p>
<p>I would like to publicly apologise for this behaviour. It was rude beyond measure; inconsiderate, assuming, and overall reflective of an entitled and reckless mindset. Every person featured in these posts has the opportunity to have their post removed.</p>
<p>To those who I have been unable to contact via email: I am deeply sorry both for having done this and failing to find a way to contact you personally.</p>
<p>I am now correcting this behaviour by including as much as possible the habit of asking consent before taking such actions. I will also do a better job of highlighting the means by which any person referenced and/or linked on the site can have said information removed.</p>
<p>From now on the Introducing post type is no longer a part of the weekly publishing schedule. I hope to still publish it in the future but for now will take the time to work out how best to do so.</p>
<p>The emoji prefixes that were previously part of regular post types (<a href="https://til.tips/2022/06/06/release-emoji-prefixes.html">until 1.9.7</a>) are still being gradually removed as I make further progress towards consistent and reliable publishing. The reason I reverted this change (having <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2021/11/08/edit-til-top.html">introduced the emoji in 1.9</a>) is primarily for accessibility; I have discovered that emoji do not work particularly well with website readers and even if they did I realised that this would be a bad experience. The information on this site should be a bridge to making it easier to use and be a part of Micro.blog, and so anything that arbitrarily interferes with the flow of said information will inevitably make it less useful.</p>
<p>As with Introducing, I have learned that I should be much more mindful about such choices and am also working to make sure that the changes for 2.0 are as available as possible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Pronunciation details in Lookup posts have been removed as of now, with existing posts to be edited over time. I am not currently able to write phonetic spellings and so should never have included that section of the posts in the first place.</p>
<p>The last version of ICYMI did not have an issue number or any contextual information. I&rsquo;m sorry for the mistake and am working on getting better at that.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>
<p>The edit for the Pins Guide was overdue, and whilst still not as complete an update as I&rsquo;d like to make, it is much more relevant than it was. I particularly enjoyed the recent release of the Bookshelves pin and am happy to have it included in the Guide.</p>
<p>To see Pins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the web -&gt;</li>
<li>Select Account -&gt;</li>
<li>Move down and select &ldquo;X pins&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are now looking at a Release Notes post, which are the updated version of the Edits category. I had become a little unfocused with this post type, having considered other ways to write about updates across TIL but I&rsquo;ve since realised that it makes the most sense to consolidate that information with the rest of the site. As such this category includes short and long posts; that&rsquo;s quick updates and announcements (like this one), <em>and</em> all previous announcements from my blog will be moved to this site and retroactively dated.</p>
<p>The Links directory continues to be updated as much as possible, since it is a core part of the site and TIL as a whole. It&rsquo;s been great to see recent contributions to Micro.blog from existing members of the community and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>With regard to the weekly catch-up email newsletter, ICYMI, the subscription page was light on information and a little unclear, and that problem has now been resolved. Each post type is covered and I think the page is a good representation of the newsletter overall. I have published six consecutive issues and look forward to including this very post in next week&rsquo;s edition.</p>
<p>Further away from the site, over on Memberful, is The Insight Program. This is the membership program for TIL and is now focused on a single plan for singular donations: Supporter. The homepage has been updated to reflect this and there are now some posts for members to see. Also, you can join for free to take a look inside. Finally, the membership section of the footer for the main site has been overhauled to better represent this updated version of The Insight Program.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>I am relieved to have updated the membership; it now better represents what is needed for TIL, as well as TIL as a whole. There will be continued updates to it, alongside the rest of TIL, and I hope to only make everything clear as further progress is made.</p>
<p>Speaking of the future, as I alluded to at the beginning of this post, next up is&hellip; 2.0.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on the next major version of TIL, and am willing at this point to say that it is entirely focused on the site itself. It&rsquo;s more than a little exciting to split my focus between maintaining steady publishing for regular post types in public and then privately building the next batch of significant updates. At this point I have never felt better about TIL and have found it easier to clarify my thinking on what should be done.</p>
<p>With that in mind, any updates between now and 2.0 will be small — likely in the form of the single-line posts I&rsquo;ve previously used — and infrequent. Therefore this is the last batched update for version 1 of TIL.</p>
<p>Thank you all for reading.</p>
<p>— Simon</p>

			 <p>Today I Learned has returned to full activity. I have recently made some updates, and will continue to gradually restore other parts of the site as well as other resources.</p>
<p>To begin with, the following is an overview of what is happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of edits have been made to existing pages.</li>
<li>There is a new post type: <strong>Edits</strong>.</li>
<li>The site’s footer has been updated to reflect recent changes.</li>
<li>The newsletter has also returned, having moved to Buttondown.</li>
<li>More post types will return in the next few weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, that’s correct; the newsletter is back! The next issue of ICYMI will be released this Monday evening (10th May) and will include greater detail about recent activity. You can sign up below, and see more information on the Subscribe page.</p>

<p>I am more than a little relieved to be back and can only thank both the Micro.blog team as well as the community. This is so much easier than it might otherwise be due in no small part to all of the fantastic people on Micro.blog.</p>
<p>I’ll say it again: you’re all <em>just brilliant</em>.</p>

			 <p>Following the feature-packed previous month there was a mix of varied, mostly smaller updates in October, which then ended with a couple of big releases.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="domain-registration">Domain Registration</h2>
<p>You can now register a custom domain in your account settings. This registration makes it easy for you to get the domain you want and immediately use it with one of your hosted sites; all of the settings are taken care of and the feature includes email forwarding.</p>
<p>To see for yourself: go to <em>the web app</em> -&gt; <em>Account</em> tab -&gt; <em>Paid microblogs</em> section -&gt; <code>Get a Domain Name</code> button. There is also a new document in Help covering the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/10/29/register-your-domain.html">Register your domain name on Micro.blog</a> • <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/domain-registration/">Help document</a> • <a href="https://micro.blog/account/domains">Domain registration page</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="check-in-support">Check-in Support</h2>
<p>It is now possible for third-party developers to provide check-in posting, after the API was updated to support location data. This includes venue name, URL, latitude, and longitude, and is not currently supported in the official Micro.blog apps.</p>
<p>You can present this data on your site via custom theming, using a parameter for each data type with the exception of venue name, which is automatically included. Manton&rsquo;s post includes an example of the code you would use in the custom theme.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="photoblogging-disqus-tutorial-and-more">Photoblogging, Disqus Tutorial, and more!</h2>
<p>A few improvements and fixes came to Sunlit throughout the month, including a new option for clearing cahed photos and old drafts. Elsewhere for the photoblogging side of things, the Photos index page was updated to only include JPEGs so that screenshots are much less likely to appear in the grid, and a there&rsquo;s a new Help document about the page and how to customise it.</p>
<p>Further support for hosted blogs was provided in the form of a new tutorial in Help, with which you can see how to add Disqus comments to your site, and it is now possible to control pagination in settings specifically when using the Marfa theme.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the iOS app was improved with further Dark Mode support and a number of fixes. Finally, Inktober was again featured in Discover <em>and</em> a new special pin was launched for the month-long event.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Icro</strong> was given a major update, as Martin provided an improvement to layout and keyboard shortcuts on iPad, support for Dark Mode, and updated functionality with posts via long press.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Quill</strong> had a number of updates to improve stability and performance, including the removal of integration with Facebook, Instagram, and flight tracking; as well as making both Twitter integration and image rotation smarter. Also, the file size limit for uploads was increased.

<li><strong>Own Your Gram</strong> has a new photo importer for importing one photo at a time, whilst real-time updating is no longer possible due to API changes from the developers of Instagram. Documentation has been updated as a result of these changes.

<p><strong>• • •</strong></p>
<p>After the extraordinary release schedule of September, on the back of a remarkably productive summer no less, this month was inevitably going to have a greater focus on stability and performance maintenance. However, with that in mind there were still significant releases from the team and the groundwork was laid for continued momentum. Also, the previously promised improvements of hosted accounts and the web app have come to pass, whilst there is still seemingly more to come along those lines before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Amongst the aforementioned updates focused on perfomance and stability was <a href="https://news.micro.blog/2019/10/10/weve-had-to.html">the removal of Facebook integration</a> and <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/10/10/speaking-of-crossposting.html">swift LinkedIn patching</a>. Whilst it would appear to be best for updates to always be additive, the fact remains that Micro.blog works best as a nimble, easily understood option for owning your identity on the web and so there will be occasions when it is necessary for the team to remove or reduce parts of the platform.</p>
<p>Evenso, the end of the year looks promising, what with such an action-packed ten months at our backs and the ever-changing landscape of the social web. I for one will be keeping a close eye on how the team continues to attempt to make the web a better place to be.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p>The beginning of Autumn was accompanied by a significant set of updates, with the team delivering a truly fantastic release schedule.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="categories-upgrade">Categories Upgrade</h2>
<p>It is now possible to assign a category to a micro post. This is done via the new button on the New Post screen, with which you can control whether to add a category or save the post as a draft.</p>
<p>There is also a new way to manage categories: manual filters. With this feature you can automatically assign posts to categories based on the content of the post title and/or post body. It is also possible to use this feature retroactively, using the <code>Run Filter</code> button to filter existing posts into categories.</p>
<p>Category management was further improved in settings with the addition of number of posts per category. These numbers are also links to filtered lists of posts per category.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/24/filter-posts-into.html">Filter posts into categories</a> • <a href="news.micro.blog/2019/09/18/new-feature-if.html">Easier category management</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="free-testing">Free Testing</h2>
<p>All hosted accounts now have access to a free second blog, should you wish to use it. The intended use for these blogs is for testing anything you might want to try before doing so on your main blog, whether that&rsquo;s a post, page, file upload, or theme edits; it is the latter for which this new feature is especially well made.</p>
<p>You can now make changes without a care for whether it will have an effect on your main blog, whilst implementing changes are even easier thanks to the new <code>Duplicate</code> button. With this button you instantly make a copy of the theme, which is then available for use on your other blog. This works both ways, since you can then test changes on the test site with the copied theme <em>and</em> when you&rsquo;re ready to apply those changes to your main blog you can access it since custom themes are shared across your blogs.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="ios-17">iOS 1.7</h2>
<p>The latest significant release of the app was made to coincide with the major update to iOS itself. Support for Dark Mode was included, which works with the system-wide setting and so just works whenever your device is put into dark mode.</p>
<p>Sign in with Apple was also added, giving you the option of instantly creating a new account or accessing an existing one <em>without</em> the need to use your email app. Full support for Apple&rsquo;s private email feature was also added shortly thereafter. When signing into an existing account make sure to choose the same address associated with that account.</p>
<p>Lastly, the tagmoji menu in Discover was overhauled to better match the web and Mac apps. The menu is fully featured, showing a partial list of the directory and a &lsquo;Show More&rsquo; button to get access to the rest. A few fixes were also made as part of the update.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="easier-mastodon-following-ghost-import-and-more">Easier Mastodon Following, Ghost Import, and more!</h2>
<p>It is now easier for Mastodon users to follow people on Micro.blog, with a special version of the profile page accessible via following from Mastodon. Meanwhile, support for importing from Ghost blogs was added for Hosted blogs.</p>
<p>Further third party support was added in the form of push notification support; apps can now use the Micro.blog API to send notifications, with Manton already having provided support to Vincent Ritter&rsquo;s <em>Gluon</em> and Martin Hartl&rsquo;s <em>Icro</em>.</p>
<p>Account deletion also became a lot easier via the new <em>Deleting your account</em> Help document, which includes relevant information. Finally, the Micro Monday newsletter returned with a big post-summer catch up!</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gluon</strong> was given a significant collection of updates throughout the month. Vincent added push notifications, iPad support, a pure black theme, displaying first name, and impactful speed improvements. It&rsquo;s also great to see Vincent continuing his work on refining the design of the app.

<li><strong>Indigenous</strong> also received multiple updates as progress continues towards the first full version of the app. Kristof added accessibility improvements, global search, image upload on reply, an &lsquo;Unread items&rsquo; channel, and auto submit of share intents, whilst a number of fixes were also made.

<li><a href="https://indigenous.realize.be/">Indigenous, by Kristof De Jaeger</a> • <a href="https://realize.be/">Kristof&rsquo;s blog</a></li>

<li><strong>Quill</strong> was updated with a dropdown menu for choosing post status &ndash; Published or Draft &ndash; which can be found in the <code>Publish</code> settings of the main <em>Editor</em>.

<li><a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill, by Aaron Parecki</a> • <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron&rsquo;s site</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Own Your Gram</strong> had a number of updates covering a variety of changes. Aaron provided a significant improvement to the setup and configutation settings, including instructions for running the app yourself, as well as multiple bug fixes to improve stability.

<p><strong>• • •</strong></p>
<p>What a month! The team well and truly hit the high notes for providing not only a variety of improvements but a mightily impressive set of significant additions at that. I&rsquo;d like to congratulate Manton, Jean, and Jonathan on delivering a stellar month, <em>especially</em> on the back of a fantastic set of summer releases.</p>
<p>The official releases were stunning, adding a significant amount of value to Hosted subscriptions whilst continuing to improve various aspects of the platform for different kinds of people. If you use Micro.blog for anything there&rsquo;s a very good chance that thing was improved in some way. Further to this Manton spoke about making more improvements to the web app in the coming months, having delivered the big update for iOS. This is a particularly exciting hint considering that the web app was already improved by this month&rsquo;s big releases.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the community continued to provide their own exciting updates to third party projects. It was encouraging to see non-Apple options improved to further help the platform remain available to different people in different situations.</p>
<p>Finally, Jean is now out and about! It&rsquo;s great to see our much loved community manager continue to make progress with her recovery.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

This was then followed up with support for iPad, a &ldquo;true black&rdquo; theme, and the inclusion of both real names and usernames in the timeline.</li>
<li>Vincent also spoke about Android, regarding his ambition to develop the app out of alpha and into beta on that particular operating system.</li>

			 <p>Summer came to a close with yet another collection of varied updates, further improving the Hosted offering and Micro.blog as a whole. There was some preparation also made for autumn updates, and a reminder of just how open and flexible the platform truly is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="photos-upgrade">Photos Upgrade</h2>
<p>There is a new section of Discover just for photos, in which you can see those photos featured in Discover all in a grid format. This alternative view pairs nicely with the <em>Photos Index</em> feature from July, and makes it both easier <em>and</em> more pleasant to find people and posts through the lens of photo-blogging.</p>
<p>On top of this Discover was given another set of new tagmoji, following on from July&rsquo;s additions <em>and</em> a new addition to the Discover menu in the form of a &ldquo;Show More&rdquo; link which takes you to the official tagmoji directory.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, as part of her recovery Jean set a photo-based challenge for the community. Over the course of 11 days the community shared 11 photos, a theme per day set by Jean at the beginning of the challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/08/19/i-added-a.html">Discover Photos Grid</a> • <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/08/25/adding-more-emoji.html">More Tagmoji</a> • <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2019/08/05/a-convalescents-request.html">Jean&rsquo;s Photo Challenge</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tumblr-integration">Tumblr Integration</h2>
<p>You can now add Tumblr to cross-posting for your feed, making it easy to use Tumblr for broadcasting your blog or just mirroring it in general. As with the other cross-posting options, you can manage this in different ways across the Micro.blog apps.</p>
<p>As well as cross-posting, Tumblr imports were also improved via removal of the upload file size limit. This means that an archive export from Tumblr of any size can now be transferred to a Hosted account.</p>
<p>Finally, Manton provided a reminder of just how well Micro.blog works with Tumblr, including the new updates and a reminder of the <em>domain follow</em> feature with which it is easy to follow Tumblr blogs via URL.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/08/23/tumblr-crossposting.html">Tumblr cross-posting</a> • <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/08/15/tumblr-integration-with.html">Tumblr integration with Micro.blog</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="robots-ios-beta-and-more">Robots, iOS beta, and more!</h2>
<p>People with Hosted sites can now better control how their sites are indexed by search engines thanks to the introduction of a <code>robots.txt</code> file for each site. You can switch this off entirely or customise how you see fit, for which Manton published a new help page. Also, for podcast-enabled sites you can now get basic download stats, for which Manton also provided context for their implementation and intended use-case beyond idle curiosity.</p>
<p>The iOS beta was given updates to include the new features for the operating system, including dark mode. TestFlight sign-ups were made available whilst Manton also published a preview of dark mode.</p>
<p>Lastly, Manton published a new help page with information about the annual subscriptions which include a discount to the price of hosting.</p>

<li><strong>The Wiki</strong> was given a significant addition in the form of a new page, covering the culture and norms of the community.

<p>The summer came to a close on the back of yet another set of full and varied improvements, whilst the interconnected ecosystem of which Micro.blog is a part also continues to hum along with updates and news to counter the increasingly desperate circumstance of silo networks.</p>
<p>Jean&rsquo;s photo challenge was yet another great example of the Micro.blog community rallying around one another, displaying the <em>humanity</em> that is so important for the web. Even after the initial 11 days, people take up the challenge and those who have yet to do so are encouraged to share their photos. There was also excellent news from Jean in the form of her recovery, which <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2019/08/09/its-been-a.html">includes indulging that podcasting habit of hers</a>.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Tumblr by Automattic was big news in the world of web hosting, blogging, and social networks; it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if the blogging and social hybrid can be rescued from its somewhat underwhelming current condition. Meanwhile, Manton continued to talk about where Micro.blog stands now more than 18 months since the public launch and was able to focus on the flexibility of the platform, whether with large silos such as Tumblr or the web as a whole.</p>
<p>Autumn is now ahead of us and that inevitably brings the big updates from the large tech companies, including iOS and the Micro.blog apps for which we have already seen previews. Meanwhile, Manton has spoken about making continued improvements across the platform as a whole and appears to be gearing up for quite a significant September.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p><strong>TIP:</strong> Using taxonomy, you can set up your account with different feeds, whether multiple or single, and thus have a master feed based around a theme for the timeline. For example, you could have only long posts, link posts, or posts about a specific subject.</p>

			 <p>Summer is well and truly upon those in the Northern Hemisphere and that means plenty of updates as the momentum from the first half of the year continued on throughout the month.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="photos-index">Photos Index</h2>
<p>The month ended with a big feature release; a photos index page. On this page you will see all of the photos posted to your blog in an index just like the format made popular by Instagram profile pages. The page is pre-built into new blogs whilst existing blogs can get it via single-button access; Manton also provided instructions on how to go about this if you already have a page named &ldquo;photos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This feature is inspired by the work of Jonathan LaCour, who created Microgram which made it relatively easy for people to make such a page by copy-pasting a small amount of JavaScript into their site. Microgram is still available for people who would prefer to maintain the page in this way.</p>
<p>Manton has also since spoken about making additions to this feature, such as simple settings for customising the included post type. In the meantime you can customise the page via edits to your custom CSS, instructions for which can be found in Manton&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Elsewhere with page structuring, it is now possible to make further edits to URLs as a way to signal greater granularity in your pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/07/26/new-photos-page.html">New photos page</a> • <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/microgram">Microgram</a> • <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/07/06/rolled-out-a.html">Greater URL structuring</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enhanced-tagmoji">Enhanced Tagmoji</h2>
<p>Several additions have been made to the emoji used for tagging in Discover, covering a variety of topics. These are all available via the menu on the web, which will soon be matched on both iOS and the Mac. The tagmoji can also be accessed by third party apps thanks to an update to the <em>Posts</em> API; this is reflected in an update to the official iOS framework, Snippets, by Jonathan.</p>
<p>With regard to emoji in general it is also now possible to use emoji in the (plain-text) bio of your account, which will then appear in your profile: <code>micro.blog/USERNAME</code></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/07/08/new-tagmoji-on.html">New tagmoji</a> • <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/">Posting API</a> • <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/snippets">Snippets</a> • <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/07/30/you-can-now.html">Bio emoji</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="streamlined-subscriptions">Streamlined Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Subscriptions are now much simpler, as the cross-posting plan has been merged into the basic plan. Not only has the basic plan been significantly improved via the many updates made by the team over the past 18 months, the cross-posting plan has now become more of a confusing element than anything else. Instead, the basic plan now includes unlimited cross-posting and those who already use the cross-posting plan have been switched to basic whilst <em>continuing to pay the lower price</em>.</p>
<p>This will make subscriptions easier to understand and reduce the support burden for the team from now on, thus freeing up even more resources for further improvements to both hosting plans, the latter of which &ndash; $10 per month for podcast and video hosting &ndash; remains unchanged.</p>
<p>As a reminder, you can choose to pay for your hosting with an annual plan which includes a reduced rate for 2 free months of hosting.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="copy-html-and-more">Copy HTML and more!</h2>
<p>Another great feature was released in the later part of the month in the form of a new button: <code>Copy HTML</code>. With this you can easily grab the necessary code for easily positioning your uploaded images in a post or page. This is currently available on the web and ought to enable a greater variety of photo-blogging for more people.</p>
<p>After Apple updated the categories in their podcast directory, the settings for Hosted sites with podcast support was also updated to reflect this change. Also, in an addition inspired by Smokey Ardisson&rsquo;s <em>This Week on Micro.blog</em> the Micro Monday newsletter now includes thumbnails of recent photos from across the community.</p>
<p>On the technical side of things, performance and stability improvements have been made to; Micro.blog in general; Sunlit; and LinkedIn cross-posting.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Icro</strong> did not receive an update in the public release of the app but did get an improvement on the technical side of things, with Martin being able to remove CocoaPods from the app. This ought to make it easier for Martin to maintain the app.

</li>
<li><strong>Gluon</strong> had a relatively quiet month with a single update. However, this included a few changes with some minor tweaks, the addition of the new Micro.blog tagmoji, and the removal of push notifications. Vincent explained that notifications would soon return, better than before.

<li><strong>The Wiki</strong> received a few markdown-based additions on the main page and a minor edit to an existing category, as Smokey and Eli continued the steady progress of the new version.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://m.b.wiki.eli.li">Micro.wiki</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>Drafts Action</strong> for posting to Micro.blog with categories was updated by Craig McClellan, fixing a token-based issue that would cause the Action to break.

</ul>
<p><strong>• • •</strong></p>
<p>It was great to see the team push on and fully embrace an active summer of updates. Hosted blogs are getting a lot of good new features whilst the platform as a whole continues to be improved on a regular basis, including an eye for stability and performance upgrades. Micro.blog continues to be supported with a thorough and carefully considered philosophy, whilst also embracing new ideas and feedback on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Whilst summer can be altogether quiet for many people in the world of consumer software, web-based platforms have the opportunity to make substantial improvements before the rush of large updates in the latter part of the year and the team is doing just that.</p>
<p>On top of that there was some sad news regarding our community manager, Jean. Whilst visiting Slovenia she <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2019/07/13/i-had-a.html">became injured and had to return home early</a>. Fortunately the community rallied and offered support as they could, showing yet again that this platform, this entire project is <em>not</em> just about technologies and the like but rather <strong>the people are what matter</strong>. Thankfully the team is made up of wonderful people and Jean is a fantastic representative for the community as a whole.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p>Despite the all-consuming nature of WWDC, the Apple developer conference, a number of updates were made throughout June, and a variety at that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="monday-newsletter-and-film-fest-friday">Monday Newsletter and Film Fest Friday</h2>
<p>Micro Monday now includes a newsletter, launched in the first half of the month, and published each week to accompany the podcast. Each edition will is sent via email <em>and</em> posted to the Monday blog, giving people different options for subscribing to the round-up of links, quotes, information, and more.</p>
<p>Further community-centred work came in the form of a new site, <em>Film Fest Friday</em>. This blog will feature videos from across Micro.blog, with posts published every Friday and made available via feed subscription as well as a new account, <em>Friday</em>.</p>

<h2 id="discover-guidelines">Discover Guidelines</h2>
<p>Jean gave insight into a significant element of curation on Micro.blog; the Discover timelines. As well as providing a quick overview of its origins, she also provided the context into which this section of the platform exists and for the first time the explicit guidelines for curating Discover were revealed. Manton also posted about the goals of the platform, especially in light of further revelations about the damage caused by massive silo networks.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of potential for Discover to be an ideal alternative to the controversial and largely damaging mechanisms of the silo social networks. As such it was encouraging to see this information published as part of a wider gradual communication from the team regarding the inner workings of the platform.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="mac-19-and-more">Mac 1.9 and more!</h2>
<p>The latest significant update for the Mac was released, with a mix of improved function, new design, and further fixes. It&rsquo;s great to see the app become more flexible with regard to browser integration <em>and</em> better aligned with the other official apps to provide a unified yet still specialised experience.</p>
<p>Updates were also given to Wavelength and throughout the month to the Micro.blog servers, as part of an ongoing effort to consistently improve stability and performance across the platform.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Micro.blog meetup happened at WWDC for the third consecutive year. Not only did a whole bunch of people attend the meetup but Manton also reported that he has been asked about Micro.blog throughout the week. Manton also appeared on the Micro Monday podcast, answering more questions from the community, whilst the Micro Monday site received some maintenance to improve navigation.</p>

<li><strong>How to customise Micro.blog</strong> is a brand new resource site, made and maintained by Miraz Jordan. It is focused on utilising the various theme tools of the platform to change how your blog looks and functions.
Primarily a guide-based site, Miraz also provides links, link posts, and more in what is a striking and well-designed site itself. There is an accompanying Micro.blog account, whilst Miraz also appeared on the Micro Monday podcast to talk about the project.

</ul>
<p><strong>• • •</strong></p>
<p>It says a lot about the robust condition of the platform that this set of updates happened throughout the month. Not only did Apple&rsquo;s major event <em>not</em> derail this activity but it also had no negative effect on the wider ecosystem, including the community; to the contrary, there was a spark of brand new energy from community-made efforts of different kinds and they <em>all</em> contribute to making Micro.blog a viable alternative to the silo networks.</p>
<p>If this is to be a sign of things to come, an entry way into the summer ahead then right now it feels like the best time to join Micro.blog and explore an alternative to the hostile, silo-dominated web.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>

			 <p>For May the core of the platform slowed down, with a mixture of light feature releases, smaller updates with fixes, and a few exciting events all still making up a packed month.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="following-blogs">Following Blogs</h2>
<p>You can now follow posts from a site even if the publisher has not registered an account on Micro.blog. The system works with custom domains, following the idea that:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To find and follow these sites you can use search in <code>Discover</code>, and you will then see their posts in your timeline. If that site supports Webmention, when you reply to a post Micro.blog will send that reply to the site as a comment on the original post.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="new-themes">New Themes</h2>
<p>There are two new themes to choose from for people with a Hosted site: Minos and Hello, both of which have been adapted from existing Hugo themes. The release of the themes includes their availability on the Micro.blog GitHub organisation, and was quickly followed up with fixes.</p>
<p>They are as customisable as any other theme, whether you use the template system, custom CSS, edit the footer with HTML and/or JavaScript, or a mix of any of those options. One example of how to use the template system was provided via a guide for creating a custom home page, whether with any HTML you would like or even using categories to include certain posts.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="new-home-and-more">New Home and more!</h2>
<p>There is a new home page for Micro.blog, specifically for people who are new to the platform or who do not have an account. The redesign includes much more relevant information about the platform as a whole and can also be accessed by opening a private window or signing out of your account. On top of this Manton also published a post to outline how Micro.blog can fulfil an important promise; the fastest way to blog.</p>
<p>Elsewhere there was one final set of Sunlit fixes, finishing off a collection of minor updates in the aftermath of the recent significant changes.</p>
<p>From a less technical perspective, a special section of Discover was launched to cover Apple&rsquo;s big summer event, WWDC. Also, a new spring giveaway was launched in which you could invite people to the platform and include 3 free months of hosting. Finally, the month ended with an invitation from both Jean and Manton to submit questions for the latter, with the imminent release of a special Q&amp;A edition of Micro Monday.</p>

<p><strong>• • •</strong></p>
<p>As we get close to the halfway point of the year it&rsquo;s fair to say that it is now much clearer as to the basic shape of Micro.blog, at least from a broader perspective, and whilst there are still rough edges to smooth out as the platform grows there has also been lots of progress already with regard to performance and stability improvements. This is a positive indicator that the platform has a certain type of maturity built into it, which in itself is not especially surprising considering the philosophy with which it is built, that of the strong foundations of the open web.</p>
<p>A good example of this maturity, and general expansion is WWDC Discover. This update meant that the main section of Discover was allowed to continue featuring a range of subjects and posts, whilst it was possible for those following WWDC to see what the community was saying about the event.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there was literal exciting news in the form of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-indie-social-media-save-us">an article in The New Yorker</a>, in which Cal Newport mentioned Micro.blog as an example of the web attempting to counter the behemoths of the social silos. This article was then <a href="https://blog.simonwoods.online/2019/05/19/boom-front-page.html">listed on Techmeme, including a reference to Manton&rsquo;s tweet</a> (which he had of course cross-posted from his original blog post). To those who have joined the community as a result of this coverage: hello! Welcome to Micro.blog. :)</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p>Here is what&rsquo;s been happening elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit, by Daniel Jalkut</a></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now get MarsEdit on Setapp, an app subscription service for the Mac. Daniel has now made integrated publishing with Micro.blog on the Mac even more accessible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vincentritter.com/projects/gluon-for-micro-blog">Gluon, by Vincent Ritter</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The new version of the app was launched as an Alpha build on Android. Meanwhile, push notifications were removed from the iOS beta version whilst small tweaks were made. Then Vincent updated the Discover tab for both versions with a menu for tagmoji and applied fixes to the Android app. Discover was further enhanced with search, which can be filtered by posts or users, and includes the recently announced domain-name search feature. Another tentpole feature was added in the form of posting, initially in a limited form with more to soon be added.</li>
<li>Vincent has continued to blog about his development &ndash; including a particularly exciting tease in his latest post &ndash; and it certainly looks like he is well on his way to producing an impressive first full version of the app, as well as being the first cross-platform native app developer for Micro.blog</li>
</ul>

			 <p>For the second consecutive month it was full steam ahead, a thorough mix of big new features, enhancements, fixes, and most excitedly a big push for cross-platform updates. The different parts of Micro.blog have been brought into line with regard to necessary uniformity so that the platform is as coherent as possible, all whilst retaining the separate platform-specific flavours.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<p>With one of the biggest updates of the year, a new type of media has been introduced in the form of support for video hosting and publishing. You can now upload videos to your account, either directly with the same button for uploading a photo or using the <em>Upload Manager</em> on the web.</p>
<p>This is best used for short videos, with a limit of 45 MB per upload, and is available on the web, iOS, the Mac, and in Sunlit. You can also play video inline, whilst a number of updates have been applied across the platform to further improve the performance of this feature, as well as an accompanying guide.</p>
<p>To access this feature you&rsquo;ll need the same Hosted subscription required for podcast publishing.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="edit-post-date">Edit Post Date</h2>
<p>It is now possible to change the published date on existing posts, using the <code>Posts</code> tab on the web. This makes it possible for imported posts to be changed to match their initial published date, should that be required, as well as modifying specific types of post to a date better suited for their purpose.</p>
<p>This additions is also the first hint at the possible future of the post editor being a powerful publishing tool; for example, that could include full post scheduling. Meanwhile, drafts will now be published at the date of posting rather than when initially saved.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="window-resizing-search-in-sunlit-and-more">Window resizing, search in Sunlit, and more!</h2>
<p>You can now resize the window of the Mac app! There is still a limit on the size but it is much larger than the fixed version. Also, in the Posts list you will now see thumbnail previews of videos, whilst the app has received a few other fixes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in Sunlit you can now search for people in the <code>Discover</code> tab; simply scroll up and you will get access to the search bar. You can now also tap and hold the <em>New Post</em> button to access posting from external sources. In the Micro.blog iOS app the <em>New Post</em> and <em>Reply</em> buttons have been refreshed with a new design that is better matched with Sunlit; this is indicative of continued efforts to maintain and improve Micro.blog across all of the apps, as a group, whenever possible.</p>

<li><strong>Indigenous</strong> gained a few significant features as well as a number of tweaks and fixes as Kristof continues the momentum of the past few months. You can now get push notifications (via Pushy.me), mark all as read button for high volume feeds, search for posts, and filter timelines via URL.

<p><strong>• • •</strong></p>
<p>The obvious focus for this month with regard to the core was Video, not least because it ticks a big box for media-based publishing. However, I found a significant aspect of this was in the platform-wide approach of updates from the team; not only was the feature rolled out to each part of Micro.blog but it was equally supported thereafter. This marks a significant point in the history of the platform, wherein we see the great potential of small platforms built on good standards with a consistent and careful approach for how best to work in the best interests of the web as a whole.</p>
<p>This continues to be an exciting year, and with the developer conferences of the dominant vendors soon upon us it&rsquo;s fair to say we&rsquo;re just getting started. Not only that but the momentum of the independent web has continued apace, with yet more people talking about it, and those of us already exploring this space anew finding more and more positives in a life not lead by the corporate silos.</p>
<p>Even with this continued dialogue, Micro.blog continues to be a space where you can simply enjoy the freedom of posting to the web without even needing to care about the technical underpinnings or the philosophical foundations. The platform continues to be the ideal space for those people who simply wish to share any particular aspect of their life, with ever decreasing fiction and an ever-growing community. And that&rsquo;s pretty damned good.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your week!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you want to arrange multiple photos in your post, you can use either the web app or Sunlit. On the web you can do so in a new post with manual linking <em>or</em> edit an existing post to then use manual linking. Sunlit includes the auto-title feature found in the web app.</p>

			 <p>Having recently overcome doubts about the project and realising that I was simply going through some fairly predictable growing pains, everything is now back on track. As such I have a list of updates from the past couple of months to tell you about so let&rsquo;s get to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <strong>two new post types</strong>:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://til.micro.blog/categories/noted/">Noted</a>; brief updates to third-party development.</li>
<li><a href="https://til.micro.blog/categories/tracked/">Tracked</a>; a log for bugs and issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guides;
<ul>
<li>The third Guide was published, <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2019/03/20/lets-talk-about.html">covering <em>Discover</em></a>.</li>
<li>A new style has been implemented with regard to titling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Categories;
<ul>
<li>The recently launched categories feature has been implemented for all post types; you can access the basic links on the Archive page.</li>
<li>You can see the categories linked and explained on the About page, including the connected RSS feeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updates;
<ul>
<li>The Updates blog has been merged into the main blog. All posts are now published to the same site, whilst you can still access <a href="https://updates.micro.blog/">the Updates blog and its archive</a>.</li>
<li>A higher rate of <em>Update On</em> posts were published recently as I caught up after my break.</li>
<li>The History page has been edited to stay up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The navigation menu has been edited for better linking to the core of the project and to work better with the corresponding menu at the bottom of the site.</li>
<li>The Micro.blog profile (<a href="https://micro.blog/til">@til</a>) has been edited with an improved bio.</li>
<li>There is a new email address for any and all contact: <a href="mailto:tilmb@protonmail.com">tilmb@protonmail.com</a></li>
<li>Patreon;
<ul>
<li>You can now contribute to the project <a href="https://patreon.com/til_mb">via Patreon</a>.</li>
<li>This is a soft launch of sorts; regular posts will soon begin, including further details of how the Patreon will work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Twitter;
<ul>
<li>Minor profile edits.</li>
<li>Continuing updates of the info posts (look for the pinned post and regular quote-tweets).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first of a two-part set of updates, with the other part due to be completed in the next two weeks. It has been great to see the continued progress of Micro.blog, an ever-growing inspiration for continued work on this project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank everybody for your support as I worked through some issues and look forward to showing you all the continued, improved work and new features of the project.</p>
<p>Speak to you soon.</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Throughout March a steady stream of updates came to the different parts of Micro.blog, across different platforms, as part of a feature-packed schedule.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been happening lately on Micro.blog.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-past-month">In the past month&hellip;</h1>
<h2 id="drafts">Drafts</h2>
<p>It is now possible to save unpublished versions of your posts, using the <em>Save Draft</em> button. Your drafts will then appear in the <code>Posts</code> section of the <code>Posts</code> tab. This is available both on the web and in the Mac app, the latter of which has been updated with a brand new <code>Posts</code> tab.</p>
<p>Further support for this is included in an API update, with which developers can now fully support both drafts and editing.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="sunlit-refresh">Sunlit Refresh</h2>
<p>In a major update, the photoblogging app now works in a way similar to the other official apps. This includes the removal of the Stories tab and unification of short and long posts into the same screen; the auto-title feature has also been added, wherein once you add 5 or more photos the title field will appear, should you wish to add a title to your post.</p>
<p>Manton also published an outline of Sunlit&rsquo;s purpose within the context of both Micro.blog and the independent web as a whole.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/03/20/sunlit-now-available.html">Sunlit 2.4</a> • <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunlit/id1334727769?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Sunlit App Store Preview</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="portable-data-and-more">Portable Data and more!</h2>
<p>Hosted Micro.blog data has become significantly more portable thanks to a mix of updates, primary amongst which is the new export option: Blog Archive Export, or <code>.bar</code>. With this you can export your entire site, including uploads. Manton also published an accompanying guide <em>and</em> uploaded the archive theme to GitHub.</p>
<p>It is also now possible to import your data from both Medium and Tumblr, including images, titles, and dates.</p>
<p>For accounts, further flexibility was gained with the introduction of a new subscription payment option: annual. You can pay for this subscription at the same discounted price of subscription gifts.</p>

<li><strong>Gluon</strong> received a whole bunch of additions; replying, theme switcher, appearance settings screen and associated settings, tap to reload feed, push notifications, increased TestFlight capacity, the new Android Alpha released, and Android dark mode. Vincent also provided a collection of screenshots in blog posts as part of his ongoing development.

<li><strong>Indigenous</strong> for Android also got a slew of updates; drafts for all post types, edit published date, notifications, image captions, custom mark as read, and a number of other tweaks and fixes. This was a thorough mixture of tentpole features and iterative improvements, some of which was covered on Kristof&rsquo;s blog.

<p>As Micro.blog keeps hitting milestones by way of what many would consider <em>tentpole features</em> it&rsquo;s become more and more clear just how well focused the team&rsquo;s efforts continue to be. The core is made for specific ideas, with a balance of strong opinions and considerations for different uses, whilst the technical underpinnings are both maintained and further developed to guarantee the platform&rsquo;s status as a flexible and web-friendly option.</p>
<p>Given how well the year has begun, both with first and third-party developments, and across the web in general as blogging and other such aspects of the open web continue to gain momentum, it is becoming clear that we are in for an even better year than the first two years of the life of Micro.blog. This is exciting, and from a personal standpoint, especially motivating with regard to simply <em>living</em> the part of my life that is attached to my online identity. Now, let&rsquo;s see what April has to offer&hellip;</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your week!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p>On Micro.blog you can get an idea of what&rsquo;s happening across the platform by taking a look at <code>Discover</code>; the curated hub of posts, all of which are highlighted by a mixture of hand-picked choices and automated filters, and presented as timelines and feeds.</p>
<p>You can access the timelines on the web, in the iOS and Mac apps, and via JSON feed.</p>
<h3 id="lets-explore-discover">Let&rsquo;s explore Discover.</h3>
<p>To have your posts appear in the automated filters, simply include a relevant emoji in said posts and it will appear in the filtered timeline:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whether on the web or in the app you need to access <code>Discover</code> via the section&rsquo;s main timeline. Look for the tab to load the timeline:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now you can see the main <code>Discover</code> section, down which you can scroll to find the highlighted posts:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at filters, represented by emoji to become what we sometimes call &ldquo;tagmoji&rdquo;. They are at the top of the page:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Select the emoji you want to load the relevant section, wherein posts including that emoji can be found:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another option is to use search, which can be found at the top of the page:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Type in the search bar, using either a name to find people or any word to find previously featured posts:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are other ways to use Discover, the first of which is via JSON feed; you can access the main section and the filters this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main section: <code>micro.blog/posts/discover/feed.xml</code></li>
<li>Filters: <code>micro.blog/posts/discover/[FILTER-NAME]/feed.xml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The emoji can also be found in two directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>The document in Help: <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2018/tagmoji/">Emoji in Discover</a>.
<ul>
<li>This is also where you will find the special sections of Discover, separated since they are for specific events (for example: NaNoWriMo) or because they are filtered in a different way to the rest of the tagmoji.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The original directory: <a href="https://burk.io/discover/">Discover Tagmoji</a>.
<ul>
<li>Made and maintained by Jason Burk, this page includes suggestions from the community for new filters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Discover is available to non-members and members alike, can be used in the official apps, and is available to third-party developers for their apps. It is updated once or twice per day by Jean or Manton, and the web app currently has the most comprehensive version of this part of the platform, specifically regarding the emoji menu and full search results.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This publicly available part of the platform is good for both non-members and members, providing insight into the community <em>and</em> further access to the people within.</p>
<p>With Discover you can find other people with similar interests or simply get involved with one-off conversations about any number of subjects, whilst you can also catch up on news and information regarding the lives of people, the things they make and are doing.</p>
<p>There we have it; that’s Discover. Now you know what to do and how to do it.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://vincentritter.com/projects/gluon-for-micro-blog">Gluon, by Vincent Ritter</a>
<ul>
<li>The iOS beta received a big update in the form of push notifications, which look promising based on Vincent&rsquo;s latest blogging; it&rsquo;s particularly satisfying to see an opinionated approach wherein the notifications are delayed rather than instant. Other than that he has been asking for feedback on a couple of ideas as development continues at a steady pace.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="lets-talk-about-favorites">Let&rsquo;s talk about Favorites.</h3>
<p>On Micro.blog you can save posts into a separate collection, made available in a special version of the timeline called <code>Favorites</code>. This collection is entirely private and the authors of posts you choose to favorite are not made aware of this action at all; there are no notifications of any kind when it comes to favorites.</p>
<h3 id="lets-save-and-view-some-favourites">Let&rsquo;s save and view some Favourites.</h3>
<p>Whether on the web or in the app, saving favorites means using your main timeline. Make sure you have it loaded.</p>
<p>When you see a post you would like to favorite, look for the <code>Favorite</code> action which can be found in the meta data below the post, next to the <code>Reply</code> action:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once you have selected the action it changes to <code>Unfavorite</code>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This means you have favorited that post and it is now saved to your <code>Favorites</code> collection. To view this collection look to the top of your timeline on the web:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&hellip; or in the tab menu on iOS:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In there you will see the posts you have saved, as part of your <code>Favorites</code> collection, a static timeline:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One important issue with Favorites is the availability of the feature; whilst it is available via the method displayed above, it is not as consistently available in every view, for example you can favorite <em>replies</em> in certain situations but not all of the time.</p>
<p>You can also use Favorites outside of the official apps, whether in dedicated third-party apps or those that use protocols built on open web standards. For example, you could use the Bookmark feature with OmniBear, Quill, or Indigenous to save anything from across the web.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Favorites can be used in different ways depending on how you&rsquo;d like to use them;</p>
<ul>
<li>they can serve as a simple bookmark system for different posts and replies, all saved conveniently in a separate timeline;</li>
<li>you can also treat them as a read-later timeline for those posts you don&rsquo;t currently have time to read;</li>
<li>lastly, they can be used for grouping together mini-collections by favoriting the individual posts and replies one after the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use them in one of these ways or a mix of them, such is the flexibility inherent to this simple feature.</p>
<p>As with the rest of Micro.blog, there is no doubt <em>Favorites</em> will be improved over time in a stable, iterative manner; in the meantime you can ask for help and provide feedback via the official support channels.</p>
<p>There we have it; that&rsquo;s Favorites. Now you know what to do and how to do it.</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>Much of the groundwork for future updates has now been completed, whilst I have established a steady posting and page updating schedule. Between this and the continued progress of both the platform and community, it&rsquo;s fair to say Today I Learned has completed the first phase of its development.</p>
<p>As the year comes to an end, I&rsquo;m looking at better fulfilling the stated role of Today I Learned &ndash; to help people get to grips with Micro.blog in a variety of ways &ndash; and so in the early part of 2019 I will further extend the project in a few different ways. I&rsquo;m excited about doing this but also not willing to talk about it anymore; I think it&rsquo;s better for me to simply <em>do the thing</em> but also wanted to let the community know that there is more to come. Much more.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this is the last post of the year; the <em>Links</em> and <em>History</em> pages will continue to be updated on an as-needed basis but there will not be any significant changes to those or any other part of the project for at least the next three weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the community, from the team who run Micro.blog through to all of the awesome bloggers who have chosen this platform on which to share everything they choose to. You&rsquo;re all making <em>good</em> choices and I truly believe that together we are in fact making the web a better place.</p>
<p>Enjoy the end of the year, everybody. Bye!</p>
<p>&ndash; Simon</p>

			 <p><strong>TIP:</strong> When cross-posting to Twitter, images with the <code>alt</code> tag <em>will not</em> also transfer with that tag in place. As such the only way to make sure the <code>alt</code> tag is used in images on Twitter is to post to Twitter directly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still early days yet but I&rsquo;m happy with the progress made so far. The Micro.blog team have been hard at work improving the platform and providing support to the ever-growing community, which is a motivating factor to make TIL as good as it can be.</p>
<p>There is more yet to come, as well as continuing existing efforts at a steady pace. There is no doubt that the community itself is also a source of energy and inspiration, with a growing number of contributions made across a variety of skillsets and interests. Basically: you&rsquo;re all awesome. Thank you.</p>
<p>If there is anything you want to correct or generally comment on you can use the new contact section of the <em>About</em> page to do so. In the meantime, that&rsquo;s all for now. Bye!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://til.micro.blog/2018/11/20/guide-pins.html">Let&#39;s talk about: Pins</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://til.micro.blog/2018/11/20/guide-pins.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-20 22:02:00 &#43;0000">Nov 20, 2018</time></a>

			 <p>On Micro.blog you can collect pins for your account, represented by unique icons you can see within your account. They are available on the web and are unlocked by reaching certain milestones or other conditions, such as <em>publishing your first post to the Micro.blog timeline</em>, or <em>posting after midnight</em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="lets-get-our-hands-on-the-pins">Let&rsquo;s get our hands on the Pins.</h3>
<p>Getting a look at the regular pins means using the web. Make sure you&rsquo;re logged in and ready to go.</p>
<p>Make your way to <code>micro.blog/account/pins</code> &ndash; as well as the link at the bottom of the Guide, you can get there by selecting the <code>Account</code> tab:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&hellip; and then selecting <code>Show All</code>. Once you have done this you will see the pins screen:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here you can see all of the regular pins and how you can get them, along with your instantly collected first pin for registering a username! By fulfilling the conditions set out here you will collect the pins; like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(<strong>NOTE:</strong> To collect the <em>Custom Domain</em> pin you will need a hosted account, with which you can map your custom domain to your hosted site.)</p>
<p>The collection of default pins are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Welcome:</strong> Every account starts with this pin. It&rsquo;s a word of thanks for creating an account.</li>
<li><strong>First!:</strong> You unlock this pin the first time you post to your account.</li>
<li><strong>10 Posts:</strong> Once you have published 10 posts you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>25 Posts:</strong> Once you have published 25 posts you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Blogger:</strong> Once you have published at least 1 post every day for 30 days you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>Micro Monday:</strong> The moment you partake in <a href="https://til.micro.blog/2019/03/11/tip-you-can.html">Micro Monday</a> for the first time you will have also unlocked this pin.</li>
<li><strong>Photoblog:</strong> The first time you publish a post with a photo in it you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Challenge:</strong> If you publish a post with a photo every day for 7 days you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>30-day Photo Challenge:</strong> If you publish a post with a photo every day for 30 days you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Domain:</strong> Should you choose to subscribe to a Hosted plan and configure your site with a custom domain this pin will appear.</li>
<li><strong>Night Owl:</strong> As soon as you publish a post after midnight you will unlock this pin.</li>
<li><strong>Bookshelves:</strong> Upon adding a book to a bookshelf you&rsquo;ll unlock this pin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time you can also collect <em>special pins</em>. These are  usually limited to specific events, announced by Manton ahead of time. For example, in 2018 the two biggest Apple public events had the following pins:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The collection of special pins are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Happy Holidays:</strong> Made for mentioning a winter holiday celebration in late December.</li>
<li><strong>Halloween:</strong> Made for mentioning pumpkins or Halloween at the end of October.</li>
<li><strong>Inktober:</strong> Made for the drawing challenge in October 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Microblogvember:</strong> Made for the posting challenge in November 2019.</li>
<li><strong>WWDC:</strong> Made for the Apple conference in June 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Event 2018:</strong> Made for the Apple event in September 2018.</li>
<li><strong>WWDC 2021:</strong> Made for the Apple conference in June 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Micro Camp 2021:</strong>  For attendees of the first Micro Camp community event.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out if any of the existing special pins are made available again by following either of the News or Manton&rsquo;s blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Pins are a fun way to both get involved with the community and motivate yourself for posting in a variety of ways, with the potential to become even better over time; who knows, perhaps we&rsquo;ll have real pins, whether for general availability or meetups and the like!</p>
<p>Over time Manton will add more pins and continue to release limited editions for events. If you have any ideas for new pins or issues you can contact the team via the official channels, as they are happy to take suggestions and help.</p>
<p>There we have it; that&rsquo;s Pins. Now you know what to do and how to do it.</p>

			 <p><strong>TIP:</strong> The bio for your account <strong>(Account -&gt; About me)</strong> appears on your Micro.blog profile <strong>(micro.blog/YOURNAME)</strong>.</p>
<p>For hosted accounts, this is also the default About page for your blog. You can overwrite this by creating a page of the same name, enabling use of HTML.</p>

			 <p>Micro.blog is awesome. You are very likely using it, so you know this! Between the tireless work of Manton and co. and the gradual yet significant growth of the community it is difficult to ignore the great potential within. As such this platform ought to be as welcoming as possible, within different contexts and so here we are&hellip; a(nother) space for help with using Micro.blog.</p>
<p>This account will run alongside the existing official documentation, other community-run projects, and individual contributions to the Micro.blog knowledgebase. It is is merely an addition to the collective attempt at saying &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; However, nothing is so perfect that it can&rsquo;t be criticised (🛎️) so let&rsquo;s for a moment go over where it may be lacking:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not currently own an iOS device or MacOS machine and so features specific to the Apple platform will not be covered.
<ul>
<li>This will include apps specific to the Apple platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is not an official part of Micro.blog at all and so information may not be as accurate as it should be.
<ul>
<li>In this instance edits will be made ASAP and immediately pointed to in a follow-up post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am but <a href="https://micro.blog/simonwoods">a</a> single person!
<ul>
<li>Personally I believe the lack of cloning technology to be the fault of tech CEOs who choose instead to build advertising vehicles. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, where possible I will rectify each of these problems as quickly as possible. This includes reading and reacting to feedback, whether that&rsquo;s;</p>
<ul>
<li>on <a href="https://micro.blog/til">Micro.blog</a>;</li>
<li>at <a href="https://twitter.com/til_mb">the accompanying Twitter account (including DM)</a>;</li>
<li>or via email: til[at]fastmail[dot]net.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least is another part of <em>Today I Learned</em>: <a href="https://updates.micro.blog">Updates</a>, the companion blog focused solely on providing a log of any and all updates to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>More information can be found <a href="https://til.micro.blog/about">in the About page</a> and any updates to the project will be provided as soon as anything of note happens.</p>
<p>So here we are, ready to start. Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
